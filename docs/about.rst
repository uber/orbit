About Orbit
============

Orbit is a Python package for Bayesian time series modeling and inference. It provides a
familiar and intuitive initialize-fit-predict interface for working with
time series tasks, while utilizing probabilistic programing languages under
the hood.

Currently, it supports the following models:

-  Damped Local Trend (DLT)
-  Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
-  Local Global Trend (LGT)
-  Kernel-based Time-varying Regression (KTR)

It also supports the following sampling methods for model estimation:

-  Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as a full sampling method
-  Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) as a point estimate method
-  Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) as a hybrid-sampling method on approximate
   distribution
   
Under the hood, the package is leveraging probabilistic program such as `pyro <https://pyro.ai/>`__ and `PyStan 2.0
