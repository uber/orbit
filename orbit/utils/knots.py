    There are three ways to get the knot index:
    1. With number of observations supplied, calculate the knots location and indices based on
    number of segments specified and knot indices will be evenly distributed
    2. With number of observations supplied, calculate the knots location and indices based on

    ----------
    num_of_obs : int
        number of observations to derive segments and knots; will be ignored if knot_dates is not None
